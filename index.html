        <h2 class="display-6 lh-base mt-3">A Little About Me</h2>
        <p class="fs-6 lh-base">I live in Norman, Oklahoma, I have a husband named Neil and a puppy named Oliver, and I have no idea what I'm doing! </p>

        <p class="fs-6 lh-base">I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas but came to Oklahoma in 2014 to attend college at the University of Oklahoma. I thought I wanted to be an engineer... until I realized how much math was involved! I changed my major to architecture and then eventually to Art and Technology. By the time I graduated, I had been in college for 5.5 years, and the number of classes I'd taken gave me a pretty exhaustive degree title: Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art, Technology, and Culture with Emphases in Photography and Architecture and Minors in Art History and Environmental Sustainability. Ridiculous, right?</p>

        <p class="fs-6 lh-base">I left college sure that I wanted to be a graphic designer but... I couldn't find a job to save my life. Thankfully, I was offered a job managing social media accounts for The Chickasaw Nation. I accepted thinking that it would be something I would do for 6 months or so while I looked for a job in graphic design, I never thought I would love it! I decided that I wanted to learn more about managing social media, so in January 2021 I started my Graduate studies at The University of Florida in Mass Communication. I am now over halfway done with my degree and I left my job with the Chickasaw Nation after 2 awesome years to find something a bit closer to home. I am currently the Digital Media Manager at <a href="https://www.jones.pr/"  target="_blank" class="link-info">Jones PR</a> in Oklahoma City and I absolutely love my job! I get to work with 20+ clients managing social strategies, digital ad campaigns, and so much more.</p>

        <p class="fs-6 lh-base">I met Neil while I was a student in the Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band. We started dating in August 2016 and were married in October 2019, so we are coming up on 6 years together! We still love supporting the OU band, and we volunteer throughout the entire season. I recently joined the  <a href="https://www.oupridealumni.org/"  target="_blank" class="link-info">OU Band Alumni Association</a> after realizing that they had an outdated website and no social media, yet they couldn't figure out why none of the younger alumni wanted to join! I'm slowly whipping everything into shape and bringing the organization into the modern age, but it's a lot of fun being the youngest board member by about 30 years.</p>

        <p class="fs-6 lh-base">I love reading, music, and taking Oliver on walks. Fun fact: I love 5Ks and I plan to do one every month this year! I've already done them in January, February, March, and April, so I'm off to a great start!</p>
